% PARAMS:
% 	data: An m*m*n dimensional matrix which contains n SPD matrix of size m*m
% 	dim : The dimensionality of SPD matrices after DM
%	k	: Number of neighbours
%	Adj	: The adjacency matrix calculated by `DPLM_adjmat` function
%	M	: The means matrix calculated by `DPLM_adjmat` function
%
% RETUTNS:
%	U	: The calculated transformation matrix which can be used as 
%		  below to transform an m*m SPD matrix `x` to an dim*dim 
%		  SPD matrix y:
%				y = U'*x*U
%	obj	: Final value of the objective function
%	Adj	: The adjacency matrix calculated by `DPLM_adjmat` function
